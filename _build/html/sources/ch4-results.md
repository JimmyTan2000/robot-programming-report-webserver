# Conclusion and Takeaways
In this 8 days course of Robot Programming, I have really learned a lot. After getting some hands-on experiences, I realised that programming a robot is not as easy as I used to think. Working with physical robots is a very different experience than just dealing with softwares. In reality, there are a lot of things that are not ideal. For example, the LiDAR sensor of the physical robot may be broken, and there may be more sensor noises in a real, physical environment. Making softwares and hardwares work together requires a lot of time and effort for troubleshooting and sometimes fine tuning. 

In a nutshell, this course has taught me a lot and I am very satisfied with the outcome.
